# ChessEngine
This is my attempt on a Chess Engine with a GUI.
It currently holds the following optimizations and is still being developed:
- bitboards
- alpha beta pruning
- move ordering
- depth 6 (technically a bit deeper because on the lowest level it searches for captures till there are no more)
